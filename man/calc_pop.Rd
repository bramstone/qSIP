  "linear"), mu = 0.6, correction = FALSE, offset_taxa = 0.1,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data as a \code{phyloseq} object}

\item{ci_method}{Character value indicating how to calculate confidence intervals of stable isotope atom excess.
Options are \code{bootstrap} or \code{none} (see \code{details} below for discussion on their differences).
The default is \code{none} indicating that no confidence intervals will be calculated.}

\item{ci}{Numeric value from 0 to 1 indicating the width of the confidence interval for bootsrapped atom excess values.}

\item{iters}{Number of (subsampling) iterations to conduct to calculate confidence intervals. Default is \code{999}.}

\item{filter}{Logical vector specifying whether or not to filter taxa from the weighted average density calculation.
This will require \code{data} to have a filter applied with \code{\link{filter_qsip}}.}

\item{growth_model}{Character vector specifying whether growth rates should be calculated using exponential or linear growth.
Default is \code{exponential}.}

\item{mu}{Numeric value from 0 to 1 indicating the expected incorporation of labeled O into DNA during replication.
Default is \code{0.60}.}

\item{correction}{Logical value indicating whether or not to apply tube-level correction to labeled WAD values.}

\item{offset_taxa}{Value from 0 to 1 indicating the percentage of the taxa to utilize for calculating offset correction values.
Taxa are ordered by lowest difference in WAD values.
Default is \code{0.1} indicating 10 percent of taxa with the lowest difference in WAD values.}

\item{max_label}{Numeric value indicating the maximum possible isotope labeling in an experiment.
Keeping the value at \code{1} will ensure that the maximum possible atom excess value of 1 corresponds to complete updake of the isotope.
Recommended for experiments with lower atom percent enrichment treatments (see Details).}

\item{separate_label}{Logical value indicating whether or not WAD-label scores should be averaged across all replicate groups or not.
If \code{FALSE}, labeled WAD scores across all replicate groups will be averaged, creating a single molecular weight score per taxon
representing it's genetic molecular weight as a result of isotope addition. The default is \code{TRUE}, resulting in no averaging across replicates.}

\item{separate_light}{Logical value indicating whether or not WAD-light scores should be averaged across all replicate groups or not.
If \code{FALSE}, unlabeled WAD scores across all replicate groups will be averaged, creating a single molecular weight score per taxon
representing it's genetic molecular weight in the absence of isotope addition.}

\item{global_light}{Logical value indicating whether or not to use WAD-light scores that are global averages (\emph{i.e.,} averaged across
all samples rather than averaged across any specified replicate groups). The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{separate_t0}{Logical value indicating whether or not per-capita rates for individual replicates should be calculated using
abundances at time zero that match in sample origin (\code{TRUE}) or using abundances at time zero that have been averaged across
each group of replicates (\code{FALSE}, the default). Requires that replicate matches have been recorded and specified in the \code{@rep_num} slot.}

\item{rm_light_abund}{Logical value indicating whether to remove the abundance of taxa from light replicates (\code{TRUE}) and average abundances at
time \emph{t} only from labeled replicates. The alternative (value of \code{FALSE}) is to average abundances at time \emph{t} using all replicates,
labeled and unlabeled which is the default action.}

\item{rel_abund}{Logical value specifying if relative abundances of taxa are to be calculated prior to calculations. The default is \code{TRUE}.
This parameter is passed to \code{calc_wad}.}

\item{recalc}{Logical value indicating whether or not to recalculate WAD and molecular weight values or use existing values. Default is \code{TRUE}.
Using bootstrapped calculations will automatically recalculate all values.}
}
\value{
\code{calc_pop} adds two S4 Matrix class objects (which more efficiently stores sparse matrix data) to the \code{data@qsip@.Data} slot
  of population birth rates for each taxon at each group of replicates. The row and column specifications will mirror those of the \code{phylosip}'s
  \code{\link{otu_table}}, meaning if taxa are listed on the table rows, they will in the resulting S4 Matrix class.

  Note that the bootstrap method produces a \emph{single} bootstrapped median (and matching confidence intervals) for groups of replicates,
  either grouped by isotope treatment alone, or also by some other grouping factor (if \code{data@qsip@rep_group} is specified).
  Using no bootstrap value allows separate enrichment values to be attained for each replicate, if \code{separate_label=TRUE}.

\description{
Calculates population growth and death rates
}
\details{
Some details about proper isotope control-treatment factoring and timepoint specification. If weighted average densities or the
  change in weighted average densities have not been calculated beforehand, \code{calc_pop} will compute those first.

  Timepoint should be in units of days, so that birth will be new 16S copies d-1 and death will be loss (\emph{i.e.,} turnover) of light 16S copies d-1.
  Use of different time increments will yield growth rates (e.g. per hour), but must be appropriate for the frequency of sampling.

  The \code{recalc} argument is necessary to support the bootstrap subsampling implementation, which re-draws from the table of WAD
  values to create a bootstrap resampled WAD table. As such, automatic recalculation of WAD values is inappropriate within each
  bootstrap iteration. Typically, users should not set \code{recalc} to \code{FALSE}. Note that the true, observed WAD and
  molecular weight values will be returned following completion of bootstrapping.

  Setting \code{max_label < 1} will return birth and death values higher than would otherwise be returned. A \code{max_label} value of 1 indicates
  that the maximum molecular weight of an organism respresents its molecular weight under the assumption of complete, or 100\%, isotope incorporation.
  For various reasons, complete isotope incorporation will be impossible. However, a \code{max_label} value less than 1 will indicate molecular weight
  where 0 indicates no isotope incorporation and 1 indicates the highest possible incorporation, as constrained by atom percent enrichment
  provided in the experiment. For example, an experiment enriching soil with 18-O at 50\% atom enrichment will want to specify \code{max_label=0.5}
  and an atom excess fraction value of 1 in this case corresponds to an organism that has succeeded in incorporating 18-O into it's nucleic acids
  at 50\%.
